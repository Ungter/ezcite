## Description

EZCITE is a powerful tool designed to simplify the process of finding and citing relevant sources for your academic papers. With its user-friendly interface and advanced AI capabilities, EZCITE makes it easy to get the citations you need in your chosen academic format.

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend:** REACT.js
- **Backend:** JavaScript, Node.js

## How It Works

1. The user enters their prompt through the REACT.js frontend and picks their MLA format along with blacklisted sites.
2. The prompt is sent to an mix of AIs as a JSON file.
3. The AIs compresses the prompt and matches it with information from sources that are not part of the blacklist.
4. The relevant sources are then sent to a web scraper that cites them according to the chosen academic format.
5. The user receives the properly cited sources for their paper.
